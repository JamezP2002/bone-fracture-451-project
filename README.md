# Bone Fracture Analysis Project

## Overview
This project is designed to automate the detection and analysis of bone fractures from medical imaging. Leveraging the power of deep learning, we aim to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing fractures more efficiently and accurately.

## Features
- **Automated Bone Fracture Detection:** Utilizes advanced deep learning models to identify fractures in bone images.
- **Data Analysis:** Employs `numpy` and `pandas` for efficient data manipulation and analysis, aiding in the pre-processing of medical images.
- **Deep Learning Model Training:** Uses the `fastai` and `torch` libraries for training sophisticated neural network models capable of recognizing various types of bone fractures.
